# Simple Tkinter AVIâ†’MP4 convertor

It is a simple application based on Tkinter and Moviepy to convert AVI video to MP4 video. 




## Installation

First you need to create a virtual environment using Python 3.11.6 (only this version was tested). You can easilly perform that in PyCharm. 

Otherwise you can open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment named `venv`:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, you can do this by running:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS and Linux, you can do this by running:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
